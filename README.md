# Clank and the Toy Factory - OneGameAMonth - April 2013

## Overview

2d platform game. The player controls the titular 'Clank', a robot guard at a
Toy Factory. In a thunderstorm, the factory is struck by lightning and the
machinery goes haywire. Clank has to find the main generator room to switch
everything off.

The controls are simple: left and right arrow keys to move, and the up arrow key
to jump. Pressing the up arrow key while Clank is in the air will trigger his
jets, which will let him jump higher.

## Dependencies

* [jaws - Javascript graphics library](https://github.com/ippa/jaws)

I've included the library in the src directory so that this project contains
the correct version of it, in case later versions introduce breaking changes
(though as it hasn't been updated recently, this seems unlikely).
